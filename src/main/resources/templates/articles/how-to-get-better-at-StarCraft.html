<h1>How to get better at StarCraft</h1>
<p>Today I’d like to share you all you guys about how I’ve started playing StarCraft again after the last time I played them which was like 7 or 8 years ago. It was when they didn’t have any idea what StarCraft 2 might look like, and the newest version at the moment was Broodwar. I didn’t even officially ‘play’ it to be honest, unless putting in a bunch of cheat codes and going against the easiest bot, even when I was basically invincible with the cheat is considered ‘play’. However, I was still worried when I going through the game. I guess because I was just a kid: I was afraid to let a couple of my little marines die during the battle or in the process of over-stimming my marines; I was intimidated by the ‘fog area’ of the mini map, which is basically anywhere else but your own base. Worst of all, I was scared of defeat: the helpless feeling when you witness the enemy troops flood in your main base and decimate your infrastructures but you couldn’t do anything about it. Luckily, since I grow a little older, and I don’t really care about sending out all of my SCVs just to get them all grilled under the opponent’s firepower, I kind of get over that ‘fear of failure’ because after all, it’s just a game. After you quit, you may feel sad and disappointed for 15 minutes but after that everything will be themselves again, and all you’ll actually lose is a few hours at most. So I get less scared and start to play the game the way it should be played. I don’t expect, however, to get good at this game at an exponential rate like I’m experiencing right now. Maybe it’s just a ‘newbie gains’, just like when you first start lifting weights, you build a lot more muscles in a year or two than the next 10 years. Who knows? But for those who interested, here’s what I did.
Before I even start to download and install the game, I watched pro games, or pretty much any games that are casted by Husky, for the majority of the time. I watched their opening build, their play style and their level of aggression throughout the game. Meanwhile I listened closely to what Husky himself has to say about any given moments: how the banelings were setup outside the opponent’s base, how the archons went from chasing to being chased because of the ghost’s EMP, or how a flock of 15 multalisks was flying just a couple seconds ahead of the overseer and ended up being torn apart by 3 burrowed widow mines for a couple of SCVs, etc. Those are just little things, but in the end, if you let them ‘snow ball’ uncontrollably, it will bite you back in the ass. And I never want to get bitten in the ass so I study them. At some points, I even wrote down the Husky’s so-claimed ‘Pro tips of the day’ that Husky said throughout random games into my notebook. 
Once I did it for a while, I happened to found out that one of my good long-time-no-see friends also plays StarCraft. For the sake of simplicity, let’s just call him Bob. So we chatted, and Bob promised he would play me one day. I didn’t know how good he was, so I myself had to assume he was better than me since he was playing StarCraft and I only WATCHED people play StarCraft. Boy, was I nervous! I came up with the excuse that my laptop was too weak and couldn’t handle StarCraft 2, but I know we’ll play each other eventually, so I download and install StarCraft on my cousin’s desktop. I started to practice against computer, it doesn’t turn out to be that bad but I wanted to fine tune my unit controlling skillset and get used to do the game hotkeys. So I practiced again, and again, and again, and again until I feel comfortable. Besides personal skill training, I also asked some of our mutual friends that have actually played against Bob about his play style, his strengths, his weaknesses, etc. I then pulled out all of the tips I jot down before, and internalized all the tricks in there a few days before I told him I was ready. All this effort had been made just for the little hope that I won’t lose by that much the next game we play. I was so serious that I wish I could spend two-thirds the effort to study. I couldn’t even imagined how far I’d have gone with that same attitude that I had for StarCraft. 
The results? I straight up out-played him the first game but lost the second game because of an Oracle and a bunch of Dark Templars. It got me so bad that until now I still recall that I actually had nightmares for the next several days just because of that one game. After that game, I looked for the replay and watched it several times on normal speed, which is slower than the multiplayer speed. I did some research about the cons and pros of Oracle and Dark Templars. Then I thought about a build to counter, to the point that it keeps on self-rehearsing itself even in my dreams. Just to make sure that it will work, I also reconstruct a similar environment and practice on how to defend that attack. I did everything I could to make sure that I won’t lose to the same strategy again. No need to say anything else, next time we play I execute that moves almost perfectly and deflect all of his attempts to harass. I out-macroed him and won the game in the long run. Since then I only lost to him once and won the rest without much effort. 
Some people will say that ‘Ahh, this Bob guy must be a noob as well!’ But that isn’t the point. The point here is that I was able to turn myself from a know-nothing-about-StarCraft guy to a calm, cool, and collected gamer that actually know how to win the game. To get that status in pretty much any areas, you’ll have to invest some your time into it. Less or more time, minor or major improvement, they all depend on the person. The execution may be different but the concept is the same:   
-	See how the professionals/experts in that field do it.
-	Study the competition that you’ll be going against.
-	Spend time on your craft.
-	Look for unwanted trace that appears in the process. 
-	Fix it and improve!

Repeating the steps above for rapid improvement.
The reason I don’t list all of these in a cycle is because it can be done in different orders. For example, some people are naturally talented at something that they are able to look for errors when they study the concept. Other people might want to try and apply on their own first before seeking help from mentors. In the end, as long as you put in the time and dedication, no matter what route you choose, you will always improve and the sky is your limit.
